# AdobePDFjavaScript
I have been disappointed by the lack of viable Adobe javaScript samples on the internet. 

## Resources

- [Adobe's Open Source documentation as web page](https://opensource.adobe.com/dc-acrobat-sdk-docs/library/jsapiref/JS_API_AcroJS.html).
- [Adobe's documentation as PDF](https://opensource.adobe.com/dc-acrobat-sdk-docs/acrobatsdk/pdfs/acrobatsdk_jsapiref.pdf) is massive and, and in my opinion, could be more clear, hence this repository.
