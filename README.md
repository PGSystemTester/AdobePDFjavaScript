# AdobePDFjavaScript
I have been disappointed by the lack of viable Adobe javaScript samples on the internet. 

## Resources
- [Adobe's documentation](https://opensource.adobe.com/dc-acrobat-sdk-docs/acrobatsdk/pdfs/acrobatsdk_jsapiref.pdf) is massive and, and in my opinion, could be more clear, hence this repository.
- [Good front/back automation tool](https://github.com/nyoungstudios/Adobe-Acrobat-PDF-Tools)
